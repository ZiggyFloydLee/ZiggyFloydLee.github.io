## About Me

**Lifelong Learner, Analytical Thinker**

Passionate about problem-solving, continuous learning, and mastering new skills. With a strong foundation in finance and computer science, I thrive in dynamic environments that challenge my analytical thinking.

Currently working as an Operations Analyst on the Syndicated Loans Desk at [SEI](https://www.seic.com/). I bring an eye for detail, and am always looking for ways to be more efficient. 

Beyond work, I enjoy playing soccer, golf, chess, and poker. I also enjoy cooking, reading, and playing video games.

I graduated from Lehigh University in 2024, where I majored in Finance, and minored in Computer Science.

## Career Objectives

I don't have an ideal job title--I believe in growth, adaptability, and the constant pursuit of knowledge. I thrive in environments that require constantly learning and problem-solving. I seek opportunities that reward intellectual curiosity, analytical thinking, and have a diverse set of repsonsibilities. My ideal career is one where no two days are the same, and where I am consistenttly expanding my expertise while meaningfully contributing to those around me.
